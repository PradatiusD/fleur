<p>Raquel Rodriguez and her daughter Ivon Rodriguez are the team behind the wonderful floral designs at Fleur-de-Lis in Miami.
Raquel Rodriguez has over 40 years experience in floral design and has been in the business since she was 17 years old. Her expertise and keen design allow for the most beautiful arrangements to be realized with all budgets. Her ability to execute a favorable design each and every time has allowed her to maintain her clients happy through all their floral needs. She has provided flower arrangements for notable figures such as Pope John Paul II and produced the floral arrangements for large company events and weddings. Her warm disposition and vast knowledge make for an easy meeting, estimate, and/or floral order.</p>
<p>Ivon Rodriguez has been exposed to flowers and “the shop” all her life. She was born on a 13th of February due to her mother’s hard work pre-Valentine’s Day… and has been helping with flowers ever since. Her experience in events, however, goes beyond her work at the shop. Ivon formed part of the management team for television stations throughout most of her profession and has executed and produced expos, concerts, parties, and conferences in large scale throughout most of her career. During this time she always returned to her roots in flowers to aid during the busiest of seasons. Ask her what she’s doing for her birthday the day before Valentine’s and she’ll tell you she’s at “the shop.”</p>
